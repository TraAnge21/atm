Passion Project: 

VIRTUALBANK ATM VIRTUAL ATM is a web App that will act like a virtual interface of a regular ATM Machine (an Automated Teller Machine). 
A user holding a bank account will be asked to enter a unique user ID or bank account number as well as a secured password in order to be able to log into the software. 
The ATM will display to the user several options of operations to choose from. Once the user chooses a specific operation, she/he will be directed to some operations linked to the chosen operation. 
As any physical ATM, it will allow the user to perform several transactions as follows:

-Withdraw money (cash);
-Deposit money (cash);
-Deposit or cash a check;
-Transfers money into another account.

This software will be able to display:
- history of transaction with information such as amount, transaction time;
- available balance in the account. I will be leveraging the design Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern, Core Java, Spring, SQL, and Angular to build this application.
